# pyglFlow
An openGL GLSL implementation of Kinect Fusion using a python front end

## Installation

Tested running on win10 with python 3.8 x64

```shell
$ pip install git+https://github.com/philipNoonan/pyglFusionK4a.git
```

## Using pyglFusion


```
$ python app/pyglFusionK4A.py
```

Currently, you will have to edit the python file to select the recorded .mkv file. On success you will see a window showing the depth, normals, and color image from the kinect data.
